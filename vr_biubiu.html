											<h3>Got idea for a game name?</h3>
										</header>
										<p>Yes, VR_BiuBiu is just the name of our project folder. It's only gameplay and no lore at this point so I'm not too sure what to call it yet. If you have a cool edgy name in mind please let me know!</p>

											<h3>New Feature: Haptics</h3>
										</header>
										<p>After getting some feedback from playtests, now the controller vibrates slightly each time the player anchors to an object. It also vibrates when hitting an enemy with gun or katana.</p>

											<h2>It's a work in progress...</h2>
										</header>
										<p>
											When gaming in VR, still moving around with a joystick just feels wrong. 
											So I came up with this fast paced first person shooter where every move feels like a special moving ability in another game.
											The game is still in early development with one game mode/map of 1v1 deathmatch.
										</p>
										<p>
											How it works is that you can anchor onto any object in the game with the pink ray by holding on to the side trigger, 
											and either push yourself off of it or drag yourself towards it. Te rest is just shooting and slashing. Check out the video, 
											it's a lot more fun than it sounds!
										</p>

											<h3>Grab Move</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Probably the most important part of the game, here are some cope snippets of the grab move logic.
										</p>
										<header></header>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/raycast.pic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											After raycasting finds anchor(s), the following code captures the relative velocity of the controllers to the anchor and calculates the player's movement velocity.

											<h3>Rigging the armature</h3>
										</header>
										<header></header>
										<a class="image featured"><img src="images/rig.pic.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											We are using Unity's IK rig along with our custom code connecting the rig to VR inputs to animate our armature Bob. 
											Hopefully this can be easily extended to other character models in the future.

												<h3>Networking</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												We currently are using <a href = "https://www.photonengine.com/pun">Photon's PUN</a> for networking. It's a great tool for quickly setting up a multiplayer game as it
												provides a built in server. For most of the networking logic we used PhotonView and PunRPC functions to sync game objects' statuses. 
											</p>

												<h3>Version Control</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												As a two people team, we currently are using <a href = "https://www.plasticscm.com/">Unity's Plastic SCM</a> for version control. 
											</p>
										</section>
										<section>
											<header>
												<h3>Next Steps ...</h3>
											</header>
											<p>
												There are so many things left undone so I'll just list a few here. We plan on switching our networking from Photon to Mirror to 
												allow for more independent control of the server. That means a whole restructuring of our networking code and a new system for lobby
												and matchmaking. 
												
											</p>
											<p>
												And of course, more variaties of weapons, more game modes, and most importantly some actual models and animations
												for the character and weapon. We don't have an artist on the team so if you're interested in working on this hit me up!
