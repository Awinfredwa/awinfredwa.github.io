									<h2>What I Love Doing</h2>
									<p>My career related stuff can be found on my resume and LinkedIn, this is about the more interesting parts of me.
									</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									It's a game/tech portfolio, so first topic, the games I love. I'd consider myself a social gamer, I almost only play with 
									friends, so all the games I play are pretty popular. I used to be diamond Genji and Rein main in Overwatch; top 5% in PUBG EU server;
									and gold Caveira main in R6S. As for the games that I still play, I'm a plat Mirage and Wraith main in Apex; Emerald Sup(Pyke) main in League; 
									and Gold Jett/Yoru main in Val. Yes, I'm quite proud of what kinds of characters I main lol. As for single players, 
									Witcher 3 is definately my favorite. I'm currently playing Black Myth Wukong and Elden Rings is next in line. 
								</p>
								<p>
									Another thing that's taking a huge part of my life is the gym. Been doing it on and off for about 3 years, it has honestly became an addiction at this point. Congrats
									 to me, I just hit 225 on bench, which is a huge goal that I set for myself a year ago. As for the other sports,
									I'm decent at badminton and love snowboarding, all the mountain pics on this website are from my snowboarding trip to Europe last winter.
								</p>
								<p>
									I feel like I'm definately oversharing at this point, but for the sake of maybe if I put down more things, a recruiter might find something in common with me, I'll 
									spill a few more. My mbti is ENTP. I cook yummy Chinese food and bulking meals. 
									Music wise, I'm a fan of David Tao, Khalil Fong, Daniel Caesar, and Radiohead. 
									That's about it, peace out <3
